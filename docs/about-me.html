<h1>About Me!</h1>

<p>My name is Kasheena Walton. This is my opportunity to give you some insight on who I am. As a child I had always had a passion for cooking and loved to be in the ktichen learning new techniques. I was so in love with cooking, nothing made me happier. My great grandmother was the one who taught me how to cook, and from that point on I promised her that I would achieve that goal, to become a chef. I have since reached that point and sadly she was not here to see that promise followed through. I will be forever grateful for her and the knowledge that she allowed me to gain.</p>

<p> Fast forward to today, and I am ready to change careers and go into what I know is my true passion. I love all things computers, what really interests me is the development portion. So here we are, I am a web developer in training at Kickstart Coding.</p>

      <h2>Front-End Developer</h2>
      <p>I am in the process of changing careers, to get into the tech industry. I have choosen web development as a new career because I have always had a passion for computers and how things work, including how websites and web applications work. I am looking into becoming a front-end engineer because they are responsible for creating the user-facing portion of a website. The front-end engineer creates functioning languages, design, and client-side scripts and frameworks. The front-end engineer creates the environment for the entire user interaction.</p>
